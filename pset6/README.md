This problem set studies some facets of fitting logistic regression models.  In the first problem, logistic regression models with various regularizations are fit to the Dorothea dataset; $L^2$, $L^1$ and Huber loss are compared.  In the second problem, stochastic gradient descent is used to fit binary classifiers to a subset of the MNIST dataset; this is compared to 'full dataset' gradient descent.

These models are implemented in the hw6.py file.  Answers to problem set questions are in the Jupyter notebook hw6_demo.ipynb
