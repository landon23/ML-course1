# ML-course1

This repository contains solutions for to the progamming part of a Machine Learning course taught at Brown University in Fall 2016.  

The course was taught using MatLab and code skeletons were supplied for most problems.  Instead of using MatLab, I have completed each assignment form scratch in Python in order to develop this skill.

Most of the problems involve implementing a basic machine learning algorithm and studying its behavior on various data sets. In particular, algorithms are implemented from scratch instead of using off-the-shelf packages (e.g., skLearn).  

Here is a summary of each of the problem sets:

Pset 1:  k-Nearest neighbor for classification of handwritten digits using a subset of the MNIST database
Pset 2:
