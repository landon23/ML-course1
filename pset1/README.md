This assignment is quite short.  A nearest neighbor classifier is implemented and used to classify a subset of the MNIST database.  Additionally, 5-fold cross validation is implemented.

The classifier and related functions appear in problem1_func.py, and the assignment questions and solutions are in the Jupyter notebook Demo.ipynb
