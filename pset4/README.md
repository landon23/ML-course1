This problem set explores the behavior of linear regression on a simulated one-dimensional dataset. Multidimensional features are implemented in two ways: using polynomial basis functions and radial basis functions. 

Bayesian linear regression is also explored in the form of MAP estimates as well as plotting samples from the posterior distribution. 

The methods are implemented in hw4.py and a demonstration with solutions to problem set questions appears in hw4_demo.ipynb
