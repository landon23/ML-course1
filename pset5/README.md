In this problem set we implement multinomial logistic regression, and use it for classification on the gamma-ray dataset from problem set 3.  We also compare logistic regression against linear regression on toy 2-dimensional datasets and implement a function plotting decision boundaries.

The demonstration is in the file hw5_demo.ipynb and the code appears in hw5.py

As the training can take awhile on a personal computer, the hw5_demo file contains a few extra lines of code to save and load the weight vectors found from training to a few .npy files.
