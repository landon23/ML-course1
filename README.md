# ML-course1

This repository contains solutions for to the progamming part of a Machine Learning course taught at Brown University in Fall 2016.  

The course was taught using MatLab and code skeletons were supplied for most problems.  Instead of using MatLab, I have completed each assignment form scratch in Python in order to develop this skill.

Most of the problems involve implementing a basic machine learning algorithm and studying its behavior on various data sets. In particular, algorithms are implemented from scratch instead of using off-the-shelf packages (e.g., skLearn).  

Here is a summary of each of the problem sets:

Pset 1:  k-Nearest neighbor for classification of handwritten digits using a subset of the MNIST database.  
Pset 2: Naive Bayes/Bag-of-words classifier for spam email detection using Enron email database.  
Pset 3: Classification for continuous data using a Gaussian classifier; ROC curves .   
Pset 4: Linear regression using a polynomial basis and radial basis functions of varying degrees; investigating overfitting, etc.
Pset 5: Logistic regression for classification; comparison of logistic and linear regression for classification on toy data sets.
