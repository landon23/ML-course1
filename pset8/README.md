There are two problems in this problem set.  The first is to implement a K-means algorithm and train it on a subset of the MNIST database.  Its performance is investigated using the Rand index.

The second problem is to implement a Bernoulli mixture model and train it via the EM algorithm on a dataset consisting of English words and binary features (such as 'is a musical instrument' or 'has buttons').  The original problem set provided an implementation of the EM algorithm in Matlab, so I provided my own implementation in Python as the EM algorithm is straightforward for this simple model.
