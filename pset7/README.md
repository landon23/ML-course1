This problem set explores two different machine learning the methods.  The first is the behavior of a simple two-layer neural net on a toy 2-dimensional data set.  Its performance as the size of the hidden layer is investigated; decision boundaries are plotted.  

The second method is a Gaussian Process Classiifer.  Here, the original problem set had the students use an implementation in the pmtk3 Matlab toolbox; we use the sklearn implementation of a Gaussian Process Classifier as it is roughly equivalent.

The implementations are in hw7.py and a demo with answers to problem set questions is in the Jupyter notebook file hw7_demo.ipynb
