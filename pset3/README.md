This problem set uses a Gaussian classifier for possibly multi-class classification problems.  The classifier fits for each class, the sample mean and sample variance for each feature independently, and uses this for prediction.

The two datasets considered are the MNIST dataset for digit classification as well as a simulated dataset modelling observations done by a telescope detecting high energy particles.

The classifier is implemented in the hw3.py file, and a demonstration as well as answers to the problem set questions are in the Demo.ipynb file.
